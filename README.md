# NoSQLProject_team_mnm
Yelp is a crowd-sourced review website for various businesses founded in 2004. The data used in this report contains three collections (Business, User, and Review) from the complete dataset provided by Yelp for learning purposes. Our team decided to design and implement a database application that utilizes the Yelp dataset as the primary data source. The application is built using MongoDB as the back-end database, with PyMongo serving as the driver for interacting with the database because NoSQL databases can provide several advantages over traditional relational databases (RDBMS) when it comes to storing and accessing data for Yelp, which is a large and rapidly growing platform with diverse data needs.
The primary goal of the application is to provide users with a comprehensive and user-friendly console for searching, filtering, and analyzing Yelp business data. The application allows users to search for businesses by name, location, category, or rating, and to view detailed information about each business, including reviews, business ratings, and contact information. The application is designed to handle large volumes of data, with an emphasis on performance and scalability. We implemented appropriate indexing and sharding strategies to ensure that queries are processed quickly and efficiently.
Overall, our goal was to deliver a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly Yelp database console-based application that meets the needs of both casual and power users alike, and provides valuable insights and analytics for businesses and consumers alike.
